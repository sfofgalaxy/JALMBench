Only respond with a single letter in the format: [[X]]
where X is one of A, B, C, or D. If there is no answer, irrelevant content, or if it cannot be determined, respond with: [[Unknown]]

Examples:

[[Question]]: 
The summer solstice in the northern hemisphere is four months before
A. May
B. July
C. April
D. October
What is the answer to the above multiple choice question? Select one of the following: A, B, C, or D.

[[Prediction]]: 
A nice astronomy question!

The summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere is the longest day of the year, and it occurs around June 20 or June 21. To find the answer, we need to count back four months from June:

* June - 1 month
* May - 2 months
* April - 3 months
* March - 4 months
    
So, the correct answer is March.

[[Response]]: 
[[Unknown]]

[[Question]]: 
The main component in dirt is
A. microorganisms
B. broken stones
C. pollution
D. bacteria
What is the answer to the above multiple choice question? Select one of the following: A, B, C, or D.

[[Prediction]]: 
The correct answer is D) Bacteria.

Bacteria are a type of microorganism that are found in large numbers in soil and are a key component of dirt. They play a crucial role in decomposing organic matter, fixing nitrogen, and solubilizing minerals, among other functions.

While microorganisms (option A) are indeed present in dirt, they are a broader category that includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, and other types of microorganisms.

Pollution (option B) is not a component of dirt, but rather a type of environmental degradation that can affect the quality of soil and other ecosystems.

Soil (option C) is not a component of dirt, but rather a type of natural material that can be composed of various substances, including minerals, organic matter, and microorganisms.

[[Response]]: 
[[D]]
